"""Base classes for camera implementations.

The camera implementations support various backends and provide a unified
interface for capturing images. This module defines the abstract base class
that all camera implementations should inherit from, ensuring consistent
API across different camera backends.

Available backends include:
- OpenCV: Cross-platform camera backend using OpenCV library
- GStreamer: GStreamer-based camera backend for advanced video processing
- WebRTC: WebRTC-based camera for real-time video communication

Example usage:
    >>> from reachy_mini.media.camera_base import CameraBase
    >>> class MyCamera(CameraBase):
    ...     def open(self) -> None:
    ...         pass
    ...     def read(self) -> Optional[npt.NDArray[np.uint8]]:
    ...         pass
    ...     def close(self) -> None:
    ...         pass
