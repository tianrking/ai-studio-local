r"""Camera constants for Reachy Mini.

This module defines camera specifications and resolutions for various camera models
used with the Reachy Mini robot. It includes camera calibration parameters,
supported resolutions, and camera identification information.

The module provides:
- CameraResolution enum: Standardized resolutions and frame rates
- CameraSpecs dataclass: Base camera specifications with calibration data
- Specific camera specifications for different camera models

Example usage:
    >>> from reachy_mini.media.camera_constants import CameraResolution, ReachyMiniLiteCamSpecs
    >>>
    >>> # Get available resolutions for Reachy Mini Lite Camera
    >>> print("Available resolutions:")
    >>> for res in ReachyMiniLiteCamSpecs.available_resolutions:
    ...     width, height, fps = res.value
    ...     print(f"  {width}x{height}@{fps}fps")
    >>>
    >>> # Access camera calibration parameters
    >>> print(f"Camera matrix:\\n{ReachyMiniLiteCamSpecs.K}")
    >>> print(f"Distortion coefficients: {ReachyMiniLiteCamSpecs.D}")

class CameraResolution(Enum):
    """Base class for camera resolutions.

    Enumeration of standardized camera resolutions and frame rates supported
    by Reachy Mini cameras. Each enum value contains a tuple of (width, height, fps).

        R4608x2592at10fps: 4608x2592 resolution at 10 fps

    Note:
        The enum values are tuples containing (width, height, frames_per_second).
        Not all resolutions are supported by all camera models - check the specific
        camera specifications for available resolutions.

    Example:
        ```python
        from reachy_mini.media.camera_constants import CameraResolution

        # Get resolution information
        res = CameraResolution.R1280x720at30fps
        width, height, fps = res.value
        print(f"Resolution: {width}x{height}@{fps}fps")

        # Check if a resolution is supported by a camera

class CameraSpecs:
    """Base camera specifications.

    Dataclass containing specifications for a camera model, including supported
    resolutions, calibration parameters, and USB identification information.

    Attributes:
        name (str): Human-readable name of the camera model.
        available_resolutions (List[CameraResolution]): List of supported resolutions
            and frame rates for this camera model.
        default_resolution (CameraResolution): Default resolution used when the camera
            is initialized.
        vid (int): USB Vendor ID for identifying this camera model.
        pid (int): USB Product ID for identifying this camera model.

            (k1, k2, p1, p2, k3) for radial and tangential distortion.

    Note:
